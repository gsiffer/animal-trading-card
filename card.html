			<p>Essentially the Quokka looks very much like other wallabies.It has short,
				 very coarse and thick grey-brown fur over most of the body with lighter
				 parts underneath. Its facial features consist of a naked nose on a short,
				 broad face with rounded furry ears.The tail is relatively short and mostly
				 devoid of hair.</p>
